# Birthday Burrito

This code is written for one purpose. To find out everyone's birthday, then if it is said person's birthday, then they get an email for a free burrito from Chipotle.
They then realize once they get there, they do not get a free burrito and were scammed.
Then their birthday is ruined and they are burrito-less and upset driving home from chipotle.
